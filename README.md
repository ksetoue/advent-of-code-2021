## Advent of code 2021

Hi! This is my attempt to solve the challenges of [Advent of Code (2021)](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

I decided to use Kotlin this year to solve the puzzles.

### Running

### Requirements

### Kotlin + Spring Boot
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/quickstart)
- [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/usage) - necessary only to run it on your machine instead of container
- [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

Run on your terminal:

HTTPS:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ksetoue/advent-of-code-2021.git
````

- [How to clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- [Cloning a repo with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/)

Open IntellijIDEA and run the `ChallengesApplication.kt` file
